# light-ocr Model Bundle

Status: Implemented bundle contract; controlled npm model distribution accepted, publication pending<br>
Authority: model identity, bundle schema, normalized configuration, integrity, and licensing  
Requirements: [requirements.md](requirements.md)

## 1. Initial bundle decision

The first Core bundle is:

```text
bundleId: ppocrv6-small-onnx-20260713.1
family: PP-OCRv6
detection: PP-OCRv6_small_det_onnx
recognition: PP-OCRv6_small_rec_onnx
text-line orientation: unavailable
```

PP-OCRv6 tiny is a future independent bundle. PP-OCRv6 medium is architecture-compatible but is not a release target until an official ONNX artifact is pinned and validated.

## 2. Upstream snapshot

The bundle records these upstream identities:

| Item | Immutable revision |
| --- | --- |
| PaddleOCR v3.7.0 | `b03f46425e8ff4442b268ce449e3eef758146cd4` |
| Detection model repository | `28fe5895c24fd108c19eb3e8479f4ab385fbfc62` |
| Recognition model repository | `b8f84f0b80c529de40b4fbb3544b84fa7233a513` |

Model repositories:

Original official archives:

- [Detection archive](https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/official_inference_model/paddle3.0.0/PP-OCRv6_small_det_onnx_infer.tar)
- [Recognition archive](https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/official_inference_model/paddle3.0.0/PP-OCRv6_small_rec_onnx_infer.tar)

The URLs are provenance, not immutable identity. SHA-256 is required.

## 3. Observed official artifact inventory

The 2026-07-13 bootstrap download produced:

| Artifact | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Detection archive | 9,891,840 | `d218f6fbf0f1c23d2161bd6ac7f5eaa6104fa89955c09290497e31008e2618e4` |
| Detection `inference.onnx` | 9,880,512 | `d73e0058b7a8086bbd57f3d10b8bcd4ff95363f67e06e2762b5e814fe9c9410e` |
| Detection `inference.yml` | 885 | `193f435274bf9f0b5f71a929bbfbcf148282df7e633b34e7c373e8f44741b516` |
| Recognition archive | 21,319,680 | `d267ab077a44a0eedb1ea8f8c542d263f211de8e9d7a029bf9fcfff7e5a88fb1` |
| Recognition `inference.onnx` | 21,159,378 | `5435fd747c9e0efe15a96d0b378d5bd157e9492ed8fd80edf08f30d02fa24634` |
| Recognition `inference.yml` | 150,579 | `ab078671bb49f06228eadccd34f1bb501e157f7a047095ffb943ba81512c77d1` |

The values above are bootstrap observations from the official URLs. Release automation downloads, verifies, stages them into the controlled npm model package, and records them again; any byte-count or hash change blocks the release until explicitly reviewed.

## 4. Bundle layout

```text
ppocrv6-small-onnx-20260713.1/
  manifest.json
  normalized-config.json
  det/
    inference.onnx
    inference.yml
  rec/
    inference.onnx
    inference.yml
    dictionary.json
  LICENSES/
    PaddleOCR-Apache-2.0.txt
    MODEL-NOTICE.md
  SHA256SUMS
```

`ModelBundle::create` receives the complete directory as immutable in-memory files. It requires every payload named by `manifest.json`, including normalized config, dictionary, both ONNX/YAML pairs, licenses and notice; `SHA256SUMS` is the one permitted external checksum file. Recognition never parses YAML.

## 5. Integrity model

Integrity avoids circular hashes:

1. `manifest.json` contains SHA-256 for every payload except itself and `SHA256SUMS`.
2. `SHA256SUMS` contains hashes for all payload files plus `manifest.json`; it excludes itself.
3. `tools/package_model_bundle.py` creates a deterministic USTAR archive and verifies its identity against `models/bundles.lock.json`.
4. The locked archive is 31,334,400 bytes with SHA-256 `d320b799ed77511e3743c36d2f23bd8cbcd80d8070d5431f4fb0ec80daa800da`.
5. `@arcships/light-ocr-model-ppocrv6-small` must contain the exact unpacked bundle files and record its npm tarball SHA-256/integrity. Publishing that verified package is the v1 controlled redistribution path. `mirror: null` only means the standalone USTAR archive has no separate mirror; it does not trigger runtime download and is not a prerequisite for the npm topology.

Runtime bundle validation verifies:

- Path normalization and uniqueness.
- Required files.
- Complete `SHA256SUMS` coverage, including `manifest.json`.
- Exact manifest schema `1.0` and Core compatibility.
- Every manifest payload hash.
- Model ID and configuration agreement.
- Tensor contract and dictionary identity.

A hash mismatch returns `model_integrity_failed`. A structurally invalid but correctly hashed bundle returns `invalid_model_bundle`.

## 6. Manifest schema

`manifest.json` has this logical shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "bundleId": "ppocrv6-small-onnx-20260713.1",
  "family": "PP-OCRv6",
  "coreCompatibility": {
    "minimum": "0.1.0",
    "maximumMajor": 0
  },
  "upstream": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR",
    "release": "v3.7.0",
    "revision": "b03f46425e8ff4442b268ce449e3eef758146cd4"
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "detection": true,
    "recognition": true,
    "textlineOrientation": false
  },
  "models": {
    "detection": {
      "id": "PP-OCRv6_small_det_onnx",
      "sourceRevision": "28fe5895c24fd108c19eb3e8479f4ab385fbfc62",
      "modelPath": "det/inference.onnx",
      "configPath": "det/inference.yml",
      "inputRank": 4,
      "outputRanks": [3, 4]
    },
    "recognition": {
      "id": "PP-OCRv6_small_rec_onnx",
      "sourceRevision": "b8f84f0b80c529de40b4fbb3544b84fa7233a513",
      "modelPath": "rec/inference.onnx",
      "configPath": "rec/inference.yml",
      "dictionaryPath": "rec/dictionary.json",
      "inputRank": 4,
      "outputRank": 3
    }
  },
  "normalizedConfigPath": "normalized-config.json",
  "files": {
    "det/inference.onnx": {
      "sha256": "d73e0058b7a8086bbd57f3d10b8bcd4ff95363f67e06e2762b5e814fe9c9410e",
      "bytes": 9880512
    }
  },
  "licenses": ["Apache-2.0"]
}
```

The real manifest lists every payload file. Core `0.1.x` accepts manifest schema `1.0` exactly; a future schema revision requires an explicit Core compatibility decision instead of being silently accepted.

## 7. Normalized configuration

Runtime code parses only `normalized-config.json`. This prevents YAML-parser differences and silent upstream defaults.

The same file also fixes the bundle ceilings:

```json
{
  "resourceLimits": {
    "maxWidth": 10000,
    "maxHeight": 10000,
    "maxPixels": 40000000,
    "maxDetectionSide": 4000,
    "maxDetectionCandidates": 3000,
    "maxRecognitionBatchSize": 8,
    "maxRecognitionWidth": 3200,
    "maxTemporaryBytes": 536870912,
    "maxConcurrentCalls": 1
  }
}
```

Engine options may only reduce these values.

### 7.1 Detection

The initial effective pipeline configuration is:

```json
{
  "detection": {
    "input": {
      "colorOrder": "BGR",
      "tensorLayout": "NCHW",
      "tensorType": "float32"
    },
    "resize": {
      "limitSideLen": 64,
      "limitType": "min",
      "maxSideLimit": 4000,
      "dimensionMultiple": 32,
      "minimumDimension": 32,
      "scaledDimensionRounding": "truncate_toward_zero",
      "multipleRounding": "half_to_even",
      "maxSideLimitOrder": "before_multiple_rounding",
      "interpolation": "linear"
    },
    "normalize": {
      "scale": 0.00392156862745098,
      "mean": [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
      "std": [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    },
    "postprocess": {
      "algorithm": "DB",
      "threshold": 0.3,
      "boxThreshold": 0.6,
      "unclipRatio": 1.5,
      "maxCandidates": 3000,
      "useDilation": false,
      "scoreMode": "fast",
      "boxType": "quad",
      "minimumBoxSide": 3
    }
  }
}
```

The official model YAML declares model-level DB values `0.2`, `0.45`, and `1.4`. The values above intentionally select the official v3.7 general OCR/Android pipeline behavior. The oracle harness passes them explicitly. No value is obtained from a stage fallback.

The first generated parity snapshot MUST assert the rounding sequence and every effective value above. A mismatch is a configuration or documentation defect and blocks implementation; stage code does not choose a different fallback.

### 7.2 Crop and reading order

```json
{
  "geometry": {
    "rowBandPixels": 10,
    "perspectiveInterpolation": "cubic",
    "borderMode": "replicate",
    "tallLineRatio": 1.5,
    "tallLineRotation": "counterclockwise90"
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Recognition

```json
{
  "recognition": {
    "input": {
      "colorOrder": "BGR",
      "tensorLayout": "NCHW",
      "tensorType": "float32",
      "shape": [3, 48, 320],
      "minimumTensorWidth": 320,
      "maximumTensorWidth": 3200,
      "tensorWidthRounding": "truncate_toward_zero",
      "resizedContentWidthRounding": "ceil",
      "batchTensorWidth": "maximum_sample_tensor_width",
      "interpolation": "linear"
    },
    "normalize": {
      "scale": 0.00392156862745098,
      "mean": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
      "std": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
      "paddingValue": 0.0
    },
    "batch": {
      "defaultSize": 8,
      "maximumSize": 8,
      "sortByWidth": true
    },
    "decode": {
      "algorithm": "CTC",
      "blankIndex": 0,
      "collapseRepeats": true,
      "appendSpaceCharacter": true,
      "confidence": "mean_selected_argmax_probability"
    },
    "defaultScoreThreshold": 0.0
  }
}
```

The recognition YAML embeds 18,708 dictionary entries. The decode character sequence is:

1. Embedded entries in exact YAML order.
2. One appended ASCII space when not already present under the upstream rule.

The bundle generator records the resulting UTF-8 dictionary SHA-256 and class count. Session creation verifies that the model output class dimension equals blank plus the effective dictionary size.

Recognition color order follows the official YAML and pinned Python/JavaScript behavior: BGR bytes are normalized without a channel swap. The v3.7.0 Android `RecPreprocessor` performs an RGB conversion; that known implementation difference is secondary evidence and does not override the oracle.

For a crop ratio `r = width / height`, preprocessing computes the sample tensor width as `truncate(48 * max(320 / 48, r))`, clamps it to 3,200, resizes content to `min(sampleTensorWidth, ceil(48 * r))`, and fills the remaining batch tensor area with normalized zero. A batch tensor uses the largest sample tensor width in that batch.

## 8. Tensor contract

At engine creation:

- Detection input is rank 4, float32, NCHW, three channels.
- Detection output is a supported single probability map with batch alignment.
- Recognition input is rank 4, float32, NCHW, height 48, dynamic width.
- Recognition output is rank 3 in `[batch, time, classes]` order.
- Input and output names are discovered, then recorded in test-only diagnostics and the parity report.

Unexpected ranks, types, channel counts, fixed dimensions, or class counts return `unsupported_model`.

## 9. Bundle generation

The release pipeline:

1. Downloads official archives.
2. Verifies bootstrap or approved upstream hashes.
3. Extracts only expected safe relative paths.
4. Rejects links, devices, path traversal, duplicate entries, and unexpected required-file ambiguity.
5. Generates normalized configuration.
6. Generates the effective dictionary and its hash.
7. Runs oracle configuration export and stage probes.
8. Writes manifest, licenses, and checksums.
9. Runs parity and performance gates.
10. Archives the immutable bundle, stages its exact unpacked files into the npm model package, and optionally mirrors the standalone USTAR for non-npm consumers.

Production recognition performs no download or conversion.

## 10. Licensing

The PaddleOCR repository and official model cards declare Apache-2.0. The bundle includes:

- The exact PaddleOCR license text from the pinned revision.
- Model source URLs and revisions.
- A notice naming detection and recognition artifacts.
- Generation and distribution metadata.

Release automation verifies license metadata again. A missing license record blocks the bundle.

## 11. Update policy

A model or configuration change creates a new bundle ID and requires:

- New hashes and source revisions.
- Full stage-level parity.
- Ground-truth model-quality comparison.
- Performance comparison.
- Language and scenario impact report.
- Rollback availability.

An upstream URL changing content without an approved update fails integrity validation and never silently replaces a released bundle.
